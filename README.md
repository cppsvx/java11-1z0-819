##Part II: Exam 1Z0‐816, OCP Java SE 11 Programmer II
- **Chapter 12: Java Fundamentals** covers core Java topics including enums, the final modifier, inner classes, and interfaces. There are now
many types of functional interface methods that you need to know for the exam. It also includes an introduction to creating functional interfaces and lambda expressions.
- **Chapter 13: Annotations** describes how to define and apply your own custom annotations, as well as how to use the common built‐in ones.
- **Chapter 14: Generics and Collections** goes beyond the basics and demonstrates method references, generics with wildcards, and Collections.
The Collections portion covers many common interfaces, classes, and methods that are useful for the exam and in every day software development.
- **Chapter 15: Functional Programming** explains lambdas and stream pipelines in detail. It also covers the built‐in
functional interfaces and the Optional class. If you want to become skilled at creating streams, read this chapter more than once!
- **Chapter 16: Exceptions, Assertions, and Localization** shows advanced exception handling topics including creating custom 
exceptions, try‐withresources statements, and suppressed exceptions. It also covers how to use assertions to validate 
your program. It concludes with localization and
formatting, which allows your program to gracefully support multiple countries or languages.
- **Chapter 17: Modular Applications** shows advanced modularization concepts including services and how to migrate an 
application to a modular infrastructure.
- **Chapter 18: Concurrency** introduces the concept of thread management, and teaches you how to build multi‐threaded 
programs using the concurrency API and parallel streams.
- **Chapter 19: I/O** introduces you to managing files and directories using the java.io API.
It covers a number of I/O stream classes, teaches you how to serialize data, and shows how to interact with a user.
- **Chapter 20: NIO.2** shows you to manage files and directories using the newer NIO.2 API. 
It includes techniques for using streams to traverse and search the file system.
- **Chapter 21: JDBC** provides the basics of working with databases in Java including working with stored procedures.
- **Chapter 22: Security** describes how to securely build your program and protect against common malicious attacks.
