####INTERFACE RULES
######Interface Definition Rules 
1. Interfaces cannot be instantiated.
2. All top-level types, including interfaces, cannot be marked protected or
   private.
3. Interfaces are assumed to be abstract and cannot be marked final.
4. Interfaces may include zero or more abstract methods.
5. An interface can extend any number of interfaces.
6. An interface reference may be cast to any reference that inherits the
   interface, although this may produce an exception at runtime if the classes
   aren’t related.
7. The compiler will only report an unrelated type error for an instanceof
   operation with an interface on the right side if the reference on the left side
   is a final class that does not inherit the interface.
8. An interface method with a body must be marked default, private,
   static, or private static (covered when studying for the 1Z0-816
   exam).
   The following are the five rules for abstract methods defined in interfaces.
######Abstract Interface Method Rules
1. Abstract methods can be defined only in abstract classes or interfaces.
2. Abstract methods cannot be declared private or final.
3. Abstract methods must not provide a method body/implementation in the
   abstract class in which is it declared.
4. Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for
   overriding a method, including covariant return types, exception
   declarations, etc.
5. Interface methods without a body are assumed to be abstract and public.
   Notice anything? The first four rules for abstract methods, whether they be
   defined in abstract classes or interfaces, are exactly the same! The only
   new rule you need to learn for interfaces is the last one.
   Finally, there are two rules to remember for interface variables.
######Interface Variables Rules
1. Interface variables are assumed to be:
   * **public**
   * **static**
   * **final**
2. Because interface variables are marked **final**, they must be initialized
   with a value when they are declared.
